Almost final version of my trivia game (just need to remove the existing questions, so that the game is purely a trivia game maker and player).
The game's gameplay and all its files and content is not identical or directly copied from any other game. There is no game (as far as I know) that does the same thing as this game.
in this version, putting aside the existing questions, the game is essetianly just like Kahoot - allows the player to create his questions and play a game with those - 
expect with even more options (compared to Kahoot's free options) - for free - but without neither graphics nor the "mobile" play mode that allows the game to be played from several different computers at once.

Also, I've mastered the art of working with setting the cursor position, allowing for better and more realistic gameplay on most modes (for example: in the "Who am I" mode, the money left is no longer printed without removing the previous value from the screen).
.. And all text is spoken in a text to speech style, so you can even add 1000 questions to the game and all text will still be played in audio mode, with the game not even weighting 3MB,
Also mastered working with the NAudio and System.Speech assemblies.

It's still just a console app, thought, so of course I still don't expect anyone to download it. If you wanna see what it's like without risking installing viruses, feel free to ask me to make Youtube videos of me playing the game in the "issues" tab.
